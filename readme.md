# Abstract

This case study showcases the development of a binary logistic model to predict the possibility of survival in the loss of Titanic. I demonstrate the overall modeling process, including preprocessing, exploratory analysis,  model fitting, adjustment, bootstrap validation and interpretation as well as other relevant techniques such as redundancy analysis and multiple imputation for missing data. The motivation and justification behind critical statistical decisions are explained. This analysis is also made fully reproducible with R code and text provided.
